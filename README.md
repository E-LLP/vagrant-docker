vagrant-docker
==============

Use docker instead of a VM (i.e., virtualbox) in Vagrant as a provider to save system resources
(and be more *fashionable!*)

Use this sample code to build your own boxes.

It features Puppet [Chef is optional] and a sample NginX web Server


###Simple usage:
#####Builds your own docker image from the Dockerfile
cd vagrant-docker

**vagrant up**

##Test:
Navigate to: http://localhost:8080/


###Advanced usage:
#####Select your image in a ENV var


#####For a vanilla image built using the same docker file:

DOCKER_IMAGE='npoggi/vagrant-docker' vagrant up provision

#####For a pre-provisioned image with the puppet config (saves time)

DOCKER_IMAGE='npoggi/vagrant-docker-provisioned' vagrant up

###Notes:
In case you switch images do a vagrant provision instead of just vagrant up
